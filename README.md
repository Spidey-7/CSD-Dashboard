# CSD-Dashboard
Candle Stick Dashboard

Hello! Welcome to my Dashboard. You might notice the functionality is fairly basic at the moment, I am looking forward to add new features, quality of life as well as machine learning algorithms as we go along.

CSD_git file contains all of the dashboard code and is connected to the streamlit cloud which is accessible via this link: https://csd-dashboard.streamlit.app.

The Markov Model utilizes the Hidden Markov model to classify different market periods as either Bull, Bear or Stationary. Using this information we can find the best parameters for each strategy during specefic period.

Thank You for stopping by!
